## ⚡ Time Value Analysis

### Earning Power Over Time

**Year 1 Buyer (100 fractions):**
```
Years 1-3: Earn 204,400 IONX
→ Can stake these for additional returns
→ 3 years of compounding advantage
→ Can sell some at peak prices
→ Maximum flexibility
```

**Year 4 Buyer (100 fractions):**
```
Years 1-3: Earn 0 IONX
→ Missed staking opportunity
→ No compounding
→ No early liquidity
→ Stuck with what's left
```

**Compounding Effect:**
If Year 1 buyer stakes their Year 1-3 earnings at 25% APY:
```
204,400 IONX × (1.25^3) = ~399,219 IONX
Additional gain: +194,819 IONX from compounding

Total advantage: 1,856 + 194,819 = ~196,675 IONX!
```
